# D3-Hierachical-Tree
Hierachical Tree Showing School Structure 
The tree diagram gives a general overview of the departments, masters and bachelors courses and modules available at Teesside University based on the data given. The tree was created using the tree layout of D3js v6. I have included a collapse function that collapses or expands the nodes on click. I have also included a zoom element that zooms in when an area is double-clicked or zooms out when it is double clicked with the shift button.
